In this project, the wireless sensing to detect human presence using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Channel State Information (CSI) in wireless local area network is done. The CSI hase been capture using oftware defined radio (SDR) which is prerecirded data.
WLAN sensing standardized by the IEEEÂ® 802.11bf task group
