This project uses wireless sensing to detect human presence using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Channel State Information (CSI) in a wireless local area network. The CSI was captured using software-defined radio (SDR), which is prerecorded data in this project.

WLAN sensing standardized by the IEEEÂ® 802.11bf task group
